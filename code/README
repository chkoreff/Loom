Loom Version 2011.03.18.13.33 <https://loom.cc>
Written by Patrick Chkoreff

Loom is a open source web server.  All code in this directory is subject to the
license conditions described in the "NOTICE" file.

Loom provides two basic concepts known as the "Grid" and the "Archive".  In
short:

	The Grid is a two-dimensional array of integers.
	The Archive is a one-dimensional array of strings.

These arrays are huge, with 128-bit row and column numbers in the range 0
through 2^128-1.

The server has a standard API (Application Programming Interface) for
manipulating these arrays, allowing fully independent developers to create
their own applications and user interfaces.

The server also has a "Wallet" interface built on top of the Grid and Archive,
allowing users to log into the web site, create new asset types, and spend them
around freely in a cash-like manner.

The server does not do SSL (Secure Socket Layer) by itself.  For that, you need
to run it behind the "pound" front-end, which handles all the SSL and then
communicates with the Loom back-end in simple plain text.  See
http://www.apsis.ch/pound/ for details.
