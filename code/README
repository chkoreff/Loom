Loom Server
Written by Patrick Chkoreff

Loom is a open source web server.  All code in this directory is subject to the
license conditions described in the "NOTICE" file.

This code is currently running at <https://fexl.com/loom>, and possibly other
places as well.

Loom provides two basic concepts known as the "Grid" and the "Archive".  In
short:

	The Grid is a two-dimensional array of integers.
	The Archive is a one-dimensional array of strings.

These arrays are huge, with 128-bit row and column numbers in the range 0
through 2^128-1.

The server has a standard API (Application Programming Interface) for
manipulating these arrays, allowing fully independent developers to create
their own applications and user interfaces.

The server also has a "Wallet" interface built on top of the Grid and Archive,
allowing users to log into the web site, create new asset types, and spend them
around freely in a cash-like manner.

The server does not do SSL (Secure Socket Layer) by itself.  For that, you need
to run it behind the "pound" front-end, which handles all the SSL and then
communicates with the Loom back-end in simple plain text.  See
http://www.apsis.ch/pound/ for details.

= HOW TO START A BRAND NEW SERVER

I know I could improve and streamline this process, but it hasn't been a high
priority yet because you only do it once.  So here it is.

1. Download the .zip source code and run "unzip" on it.  (You've
probably already done that.)

2. CD into the directory.

3. mkdir -p data/run

4. Run "loom -y" to start the server.  This runs ~/bin/loom.

5. Point your browser to http://localhost:8286/

6. Click the "Sign Up" link.

7. Choose a passphrase for the master account where you'll issue usage
tokens.  Enter that passphrase twice.

8. At this point, in a brand new system, the issuer location for usage
tokens is at the zero location 00000000000000000000000000000000 .  There
you have an infinite supply of usage tokens.  So you will use that
location as your initial "invitation" in the sign up form.  Copy and
paste that into Step 3 there.

9. You have now created a new wallet.  However, the issuer location for
usage tokens is still at your "Sponsor" location zero.  Now you have to
do a trick to claim the issuer location for yourself, changing it from
zero to your secret master folder location.  Here's how.

10. Click "Assets".

11. Click "usage tokens" in your asset list.

12. Click "Delete".

13. Check the box to confirm, then press the "Delete Now!" button.

14. Click "Create a brand new asset type which you issue."

15. Paste 00000000000000000000000000000000 in as the asset ID.

16. Enter "usage tokens" as the name.

17. Leave Scale and Min Precision blank.

18. Press Save.

19. Now you're done.  Your wallet has now successfully seized control of
issuing usage tokens because it has changed the issuer location from
zero to your own secret wallet location.

At this point you may want to delete the "My Sponsor" location, which is
location zero.  That is useless now, so you might as well delete it.

1. Click "Contacts".

2. Click "My Sponsor".

3. Click "Delete".

4. Check the box to confirm, then press the "Delete Now!" button.
